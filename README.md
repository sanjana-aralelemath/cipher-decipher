Cryptography is the art of communication between two users via coded messages.
The science of cryptography emerged with the basic motive of providing security to the confidential messages transferred from one party to another.
This python file has code for a user-interface platform for ciphering messages and deciphering codes like in olden days.
It uses tkinter module and its widgets for implementation of user_interface.
There are 4 coding algorithms - caeser code, reverse, morse and vertical transposition.
Caeser - •	Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet
Reverse - •	Reverse Cipher uses a pattern of reversing the string of plain text to convert as cipher text.
Morse - Every character in the English language is substituted by a series of ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’ or sometimes just singular ‘dot’ or ‘dash’ and vice versa. 
Transposition - The plain text characters are placed horizontally and the cipher text is created with vertical format. 

We have a main page that shows options to select any one algorithm which on clicking leads to the respective algorithm pages. Some algorithms require a key while some do not.
